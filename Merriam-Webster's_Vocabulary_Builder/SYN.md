# SYN (Page 660)

> It is a Greek and Latin **prefix** meaning "together" or "at the same time".  
> So **in sync** (short for *in synchronization*) means "together in time".  
> And a **synonym** (|sinenim|) is a word that can be considered with another word since it has the same meaning.

## 'syntax

The Latin root *tax* means **to arrange**.

> The way in which words are put together to form phrases, clauses, or sentences.

*The president's critics complain about his odd and confusing syntax when he speaks in public.*  

- When we describe what the critics say and attack about the target man, we can use the verb phrase **complain about**.

> Syntax is basically about what word comes before and after another word, in other words, it's part of **the larger subject of** grammar.  
> Syntax is often an issue in poetry, and it's usually discussed in connection with **diction**(|dikshion|) â€” that is, *the poet's choice of words*.  

- Syntax: the arrangement of words
- Diction: the choice of words

> So, for example, your English professor might point out the *syntactic* difference between "Whose woods these are I think I know" and "I think I know whose woods these are";  
> whereas if the discussion was about *diction* instead, the question might be about the choice of "woods" rather than "land", or "think" rather than "bet".

## Synthesize

> To make something by combining different things.

*From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to synthesize a plan that could get the support of the whole group.*

- All the -- the whole

> *Synthesize* is a **very common** word in chemistry, since chemists are **constantly** *synthesizing* new compounds--that is, *synthetic compounds*--including drugs and industrial chemicals.

- **Very common word**: it is used very often.
- **Constantly**: do it every day or doing it is a daily routine.
- **Synthetic compounds**: including drugs and industrial chemicals.

> *It is also often used* when talking about writing; nonfiction writers must often *synthesize* large amounts of material from many sources to produce a book--which **represents** a **synthesis** of the important materials.

- It is also often used.
- 'Which represents' = 'which means'?

> An electronic **synthesizer** creates new sounds (which may imitate the sounds of *acoustic instruments*) by generating different basic tones and then manipulating and merging them together with others.

## Synergy

The Greek root *nergy* means 'work'.

> The increased effectiveness that results when two or more people or businesses work together.

- **Effectiveness**
- Work together may mean 'merge' when we talk about a business environment.
- **Businesses**: when we talk about company or firm, we can use business instead of these words.

*With the first company's importance in print media and the second's success on the Web, everyone was convinced that the merger would result in an awesome synergy.*

- **With = because of** in this sentence
- Everyone was convinced that
- Would result in
- An awesome synergy

> An old saying, 'The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,' ~~express~~ expresses the basic meaning of *synergy*.

### Sometimes in a purely physical sense

> The word is sometimes used in a purely physical sense, especially when talking about drugs;  
> Sometimes a 'cocktail' of drugs ~~is~~ may be more effective than the sum of the effectiveness of each of the separate drugs.


### Best known in the world of business (in the case of merger)

> But the word is best known in the world of business.  
> The notion that, when the right two ~~company~~ companies merge, they'll produce a profitable *synergy* seemed exciting in the 1990s, when *synergy* became a **trendy buzzword** (even though it's usually been around since the 17th century).  
> The idea of synergy was one factor in what became a 'merger mania', unfortunately, business synergy often turned out to be harder to achieve than to imagine.
