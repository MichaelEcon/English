# SYN (Page 660)

> It is a Greek and Latin **prefix** meaning "together" or "at the same time".  
> So **in sync** (short for *in synchronization*) means "together in time".  
> And a **synonym** (|sinenim|) is a word that can be considered with another word since it has the same meaning.

## 'Syntax

The Latin root *tax* means **to arrange**.

> The way in which words are put together to form phrases, **clauses** (|cloz|), or sentences.

*The president's critics complain about his odd and confusing syntax when he speaks in public.*  

- When we describe what the critics say and attack about the target man, we can use the verb phrase **complain about**.

> Syntax is basically about what word comes before and after another word, in other words, it's part of **the larger subject of** grammar.  
> Syntax is often an issue in poetry, and it's usually discussed in connection with **diction**(|dikshion|) â€” that is, *the poet's choice of words*.  

- Syntax: the arrangement of words
- Diction: the choice of words

> So, for example, your English professor might point out the *syntactic* difference between "Whose woods these are I think I know" and "I think I know whose woods these are";  
> whereas if the discussion was about *diction* instead, the question might be about the choice of "woods" rather than "land", or "think" rather than "bet".

## Synthesize

> To make something by combining different things.

*From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to synthesize a plan that could get the support of the whole group.*

- All the -- the whole

> *Synthesize* is a **very common** word in chemistry, since chemists are **constantly** *synthesizing* new compounds--that is, *synthetic compounds*--including drugs and industrial chemicals.

- **Very common word**: it is used very often.
- **Constantly**: do it every day or doing it is a daily routine.
- **Synthetic compounds**: including drugs and industrial chemicals.

> *It is also often used* when talking about writing; nonfiction writers must often *synthesize* large amounts of material from many sources to produce a book--which **represents** a **synthesis** of the important materials.

- It is also often used.
- 'Which represents' = 'which means'?

> An electronic **synthesizer** creates new sounds (which may imitate the sounds of *acoustic instruments*) by generating different basic tones and then manipulating and merging them together with others.

## Synergy

The Greek root *nergy* means 'work'.

> The increased effectiveness that results when two or more people or businesses work together.

- **Effectiveness**
- Work together may mean 'merge' when we talk about a business environment.
- **Businesses**: when we talk about company or firm, we can use business instead of these words.

*With the first company's importance in print media and the second's success on the Web, everyone was convinced that the merger would result in an awesome synergy.*

- **With = because of** in this sentence
- Everyone was convinced that
- Would result in
- An awesome synergy

> An old saying, 'The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,' ~~express~~ expresses the basic meaning of *synergy*.

### Sometimes in a purely physical sense

> The word is sometimes used in a purely physical sense, especially when talking about drugs;  
> Sometimes a 'cocktail' of drugs ~~is~~ may be more effective than the sum of the effectiveness of each of the separate drugs.


### Best known in the world of business (in the case of merger)

> But the word is best known in the world of business.  
> The notion that, when the right two ~~company~~ companies merge, they'll produce a profitable *synergy* seemed exciting in the 1990s, when *synergy* became a **trendy buzzword** (even though it's usually been around since the 17th century).  
> The idea of synergy was one factor in what became a 'merger mania', unfortunately, business synergy often turned out to be harder to achieve than to imagine.

## Syndrome

The root drome means 'run'.

> A group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.

- A **group** of signs and symptoms
- occur **together**
- can be used to characterize a particular **abnormality or condition** (so the words **abnormality and condition** both can be used to describe a situation when our body or mental condition is abnormal.)

### The example is about Parkinson's disease

*When there is no trembling--the most obvious symptom of Parkinson's disease, most doctors fail to recognize the Parkinson's syndrome.*

- The most obvious symptom of Parkinson's disease is trembling.
- The doctor most likely fail to recognize this disease if the symptom have not appeared.
- This situation may because of that the symptom other than trembling can be confusing with another disease, that is, it may be caused by another disease, and the doctor cannot identify which of them is the real cause.

### Syndrome when the doctor diagnose

> Combining its two Greek roots, *syndrome* means basically 'running together'.  

> So when diagnosing a condition or disease, doctors tend to **look for a group of symptoms existing together.**  
> As long as a set of symptoms remains mysterious, it may be referred to a specific *syndrome*.  
> But if that name is used for a while, it may become the condition's permanent name, even after an underlying cause has been found.  
> So today we have

- Down syndrome (also known as trisomy 21)
- Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS, which is caused by HIV)
- Asperger's syndrome (an autism spectrum disorder)
- Carpal tunnel syndrome (a condition that causes pain and weakness in the wrist, hand, and fingers)
- Chronic fatigue syndrome (symptoms include long-term tired, headaches and weakness)
- Tourette's syndrome (a disorder that causes someone to move and speak in an uncontrolled way)
- sick building syndrome (a condition in which people in a building suffer from symptoms of illness or become infected with chronic disease from the building in which they work or reside [Wikipedia: SBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_building_syndrome))

> And many more.  
> Since mental conditions often turn out to have physical causes, *syndrome* is used in psychology as well as medicine.
