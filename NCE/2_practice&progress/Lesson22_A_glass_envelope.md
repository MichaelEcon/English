# A glass envelope

## How did Jean receive a letter from a stranger?

> 我的女儿简从未想到过会收到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信。

My daughter Jean never dream of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland.

- *Never **dreamed** of*: it is a past tense.

> 去年，当我们横渡英吉利海峡时，

Last year, when we was traveling across the channel, 

- *was → **were***: because *we* is not a third-person singular word.

> 简把写有他姓名和住址的一张纸条装进了一个瓶子，又将瓶子扔向了大海。

Jean put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a battle, and through it into the sea,

- It may be better if we use *the battle* instead of *it*.
- *Through* should be in past tense, i.e., **threw**.
- **Battle** means a war, we should use *bottle*

> 此后她就再也没有去想那只瓶子。

She never thought of it again.

> 但10个月以后，她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信。

But ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland.

> 现在这两位姑娘定期通信了。 

Two girls write to each other regularly now.

- *Two girls* → **Both girls**

> 然而她们还是决定利用邮局。

However, they have decided to use the post office.

- Compare *decide* with *determine* in the last lesson.

> 这样会稍微多花点钱，但是肯定快多了。

Though it cost little more, it will be certianly faster.

- *Little more* → **a little more**

**Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.**
